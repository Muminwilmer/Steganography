Replaces the last bit in the image with one bit from the text which hides it in the image<br>
text = 10001001<br>
img = [01001010], [10010111]<br>
new = [01001011], [10010110]<br>
<br>
decryption just takes it back and makes it into text again<br>
<br>
you can change how many bits gets replace for each byte of image<br>
i recommend 1 or 2 but you can go up to 8 (at that point just use a text file smh)<br>
<br>
this also includes encryption and decryption
