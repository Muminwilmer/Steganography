Replaces the last bit in the image with one bit from the text which hides it in the image
text = 10001001
image = [01001010], [10010111]
new   = [01001011], [10010110]

decryption just takes it back and makes it into text again

you can change how many bits gets replace for each byte of image
i recommend 1 or 2 but you can go up to 8 (at that point just use a text file smh)

this also includes encryption and decryption
